The ads1298-breakout project is a break-out board for the Texas Instruments
ADS1298 chip.

Project goals include:
 * suitable for assembly by those with minimal surface mount experience
 * anti-aliasing filters for out-of-the-box use

The board does not include electrical isolation, thus must not be used
with human subjects if connected to a computer connected to wall power.
External isolation can be added, see:
http://github.com/kms15/digital-isolator
(Alternatively, a laptop running from battery may be okay).

The board should work with the ADS1294, ADS1296, and ADS1299 chips, also.

The digital power (DVDD) and digital I/O for the ADS129x chips are 3 volts,
so if used with a 5 volt controler like an Arduino Uno, level shifting is
required. For example:
